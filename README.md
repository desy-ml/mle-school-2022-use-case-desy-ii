# ML School 2022 - Use Case DESY II

Reinforcement learning is a form of machine learning in which intelligent agents learn to solve complex problems by gaining experience. In current research, agents trained with reinforcement learning perform better than their human counterparts on problems that have historically been difficult for machines to solve. Particle accelerators are among the most advanced high-tech machines in the world. Modern scientific experiments place the highest demands on beam quality, making particle accelerator control extremely complex. In this session, we will learn how to optimise a particle accelerator with reinforcement learning using a practical example.


## Getting started

The hands-on part of this session requires that you install some dependencies. Please start by installing [*Anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/)  according to the instructions on their website.

Then download or clone this directory to your machine.

With Anaconda installed, run the following command in the cloned directory to create the reinforcement learning environment.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Use the following command to activate the workshop environment.

```bash
conda activate use-case-desy-ii
```

Then start the Jupyter Lab by running

```bash
jupyter lab
```

You are now ready to run the notebooks! ðŸŽ‰
